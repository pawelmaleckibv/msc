What is the frequency of the meetings (Reviews) in your process
Weekly
Monthly - some people show
Monthly - all the right people show up
Quarterly

Who “chairs” the meetings (reviews)
Managers in the department area
Members of the executive leadership team responsible for the delivery of strategy in that area
Supply Chain
Data experts (eg Demand Manager, Planning Manager)

What is the focus of the meetings (reviews)
Short term volumes (next 3-6 months)
This years volumes and business plan
Medium to long term business plan and strategy (next 2/3+ years)
A rolling horizon appropriate for deploying the strategy (minimum 24 months)

How well prepared are the meetings (reviews)
Most of the work is done in the meeting
The numbers are usually well prepared but no one else has read the input
Everyone has read the pre-read and focus is on the issues that need to be addressed
Everyone participates actively focused on the issues that have been highlighted through the process
The process works smoothly, the information is a given and the focus in the review is on gap closing actions to deploy the strategy

How well integrated is your process in running the business
The business sometimes uses the numbers to inform the leadership team (the board)
The leadership team (board) review the numbers every month as part of their management team input
There are explicit assumptions underlying all the numbers and the leadership team review the issues and gaps and actions in order to drive the business
This is the process used by the leadership team to run the business
This is the process used by the leadership team to deploy the strategy

How well integrated is Finance
There are no financial numbers prepared by finance used in the process
Finance attend the meetings (reviews) and prepare their numbers outside the process
Finance are integrated into the process of preparation, attend the reviews as part of the team and there is congruence between the numbers (volume & value)
The Annual Business Plan (Budget) is effectively a snap shot of the outcomes from the reviews with little adjustment
The integration between financial and volume numbers is seamless and a rolling “budget” is operated.

How well integrated is Commercial (Sales & Marketing)
Commercial see the numbers and often dispute them
Commercial assist in putting the numbers together
Commercial own the numbers and integrate financial planning into them (margins and costs)
Commercial use the process to drive growth in value through the integration of the 5Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion and People)
In addition to (d) commercial use the process to deploy the strategy

Analytics, modelling and Optimization.
The planning processes are supported by basic tools & techniques using spread sheets and statistical forecasting /APS.
Analytics are used to understand the true “Cause and Effect” of all activities across Demand, Supply, Product and Finance.
Analytics are sufficiently robust to create a working automated model that simulates the plans of the business and provides insights to the plan elements and decisions
The computer modelling is sufficiently robust to provide optimized outcomes that deliver choices to the management teams in all elements of the process

Reliability Performance
Reliability is considered poor but not measured (Product, demand, supply)
Reliability is measured and is less than 95% on time and / or bias still exists (Product business case, Demand plans, Capability Plans)
Reliability is 95% or better (product on time, supply on time, etc) and bias is eliminated
Reliability is a given and performance is being driven to upper quartile benchmarks

Business performance (due to the process)
The process is not designed to deliver improved business outcome
Customer service has improved and inventory is reduced
Profits, costs, working Capital and margins are all showing signs of improvement as a result of the process
Growth and business improvement are improving significantly as a result with clear Opportunities (Volume & Value) and Vulnerabilities
Strategy is being deployed and achieved as a result of the process
